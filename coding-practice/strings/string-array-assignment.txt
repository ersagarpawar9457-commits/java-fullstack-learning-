Flag variable usage

Q5. Write a java program to reverse an integer array.
Explanation:
Two-pointer approach (start, end)
Swapping elements
In-place modification

Q6. Write a java program to move all zeroes to the end of the array.
Input: [1, 0, 2, 0, 3] -> Output: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]
Explanation:
Maintain a non-zero index
Shift non-zero elements
Fill remaining with zeroes

Q7. Write a java program to find the missing number in an array of size n containing numbers 1 to n+1.
Explanation:
Sum formula n*(n+1)/2
Subtract array sum from total sum
Efficient O(n) solution

Q8. Write a java program to count the frequency of each element in an array.
Explanation:
Use nested loops or Frequency Array (if range is small)
Understanding counting logic

Q9. Write a java program to remove duplicates from a sorted array.
Explanation:
Two-pointer approach
Overwrite duplicates
Return new length

Q10. Write a java program to left rotate an array by D positions.
Explanation:
Use temporary array or Reversal Algorithm
Understanding index mapping

Explanation:
Traverse string
Check each character against vowel set
Conditional counting

Q2. Write a program to reverse a String without using reverse() method.

Input: "swiss" -> Output: 'w'
Explanation:
Frequency map or nested loops
Order preservation

Q7. Write a java program to remove all occurrences of a given character from input String.
Input: "banana", remove 'a' -> Output: "bnn"
Explanation:
String replacement logic
Creating new string without specific char

Q8. Write a java program to compress a string using counts of repeated characters.
Input: "aabcccccaaa" -> Output: "a2b1c5a3"
Explanation:
Iterate and count consecutive characters
StringBuilder usage

Q9. Write a java program to find the longest substring without repeating characters.
Explanation:
Sliding Window technique
HashSet for uniqueness
Comparison of lengths

Q10. Write a java program to convert a String to Integer (atoi) and Integer to String.
Explanation:
Parsing logic
Handling ASCII values
Understanding standard library methods

======================================================================
Example with source code (Array & String)

1. Two Sum (Array)
Description: Find two numbers that add up to target.
Input: [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9 -> Output: [0, 1]
Approach: HashMap for O(n) or Nested Loops for O(n^2)

2. Valid Palindrome (String)
Description: Check if string is palindrome ignoring non-alphanumeric.
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" -> Output: true
Approach: Two pointers, skip non-alphanumeric, compare lower case

3. Reverse String (String)
Description: Reverse array of characters in-place.
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"] -> Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Approach: Two pointers swap elements

4. Maximum Subarray (Array)
Description: Find contiguous subarray with largest sum.
Input: [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4] -> Output: 6
Approach: Kadane's Algorithm

5. Contains Duplicate (Array)
Description: Check if any value appears at least twice.
Input: [1,2,3,1] -> Output: true
Approach: HashSet or Sort and Check adjacent

6. Valid Anagram (String)
Description: Check if t is anagram of s.
Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram" -> Output: true
Approach: Frequency array (int[26]) or HashMap

7. Longest Common Prefix (String)
Description: Find common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
Input: ["flower","flow","flight"] -> Output: "fl"
Approach: Horizontal scanning or Sort and compare first/last

8. Move Zeroes (Array)
Description: Move zeroes to end while maintaining order.
Input: [0,1,0,3,12] -> Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
Approach: Two pointers (insertPos)

9. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock (Array)
Description: Max profit from one transaction.
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4] -> Output: 5
