## Core Concepts

## OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)

### 4 Pillars of OOP

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Bundling data and methods together; hiding internal details using access modifiers |
| **Inheritance** | Child class acquires properties and methods of parent class (`extends`) |

| **Method Overloading** | Same method name, different parameters (compile-time polymorphism) |
| **Method Overriding** | Child class redefines parent's method (runtime polymorphism) |
| **Abstract Class** | Class with `abstract` keyword; cannot be instantiated; may have abstract methods |
| **Abstract Method** | Method without body; must be implemented by child class |
| **Interface** | Contract defining methods a class must implement; 100% abstraction |
| **super** | Reference to parent class; used to call parent constructor or method |

## 💡 Tips for Remembering

1. **Use flashcards** — Write term on front, definition on back
2. **Explain to someone** — Teaching reinforces memory
3. **Create examples** — Connect definition to code
4. **Review before sleep** — Brain consolidates during rest
