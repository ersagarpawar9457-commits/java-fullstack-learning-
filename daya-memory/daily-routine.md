## 💡 Modi's Tips for Tired Evenings
1. **Code First:** Do the hardest thing (coding) when you first sit down.
2. **20-min Rule:** If too tired, just commit to 20 mins. You'll likely continue.
3. **Hydrate:** Drink water when you get home. Fatigue is often dehydration.
4. **No Social Media:** Don't waste your limited free time scrolling.
