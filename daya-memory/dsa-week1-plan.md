## 💡 Tips from Daya

1. **Don't look at solutions immediately** — struggle for 15-20 mins first
2. **Write code in your IDE first** — not directly on LeetCode
3. **Test with examples** — trace through your logic manually
4. **If stuck after 30 mins** — read hints, then solution
5. **After solving** — Can you optimize? What's the time complexity?
