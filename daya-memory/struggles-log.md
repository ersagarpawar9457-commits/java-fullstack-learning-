## Common Java Gotchas (Reference)

| Issue | What Happens | Solution |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| NullPointerException | Accessing method on null object | Always check for null, use Optional |
| ConcurrentModificationException | Modifying collection while iterating | Use Iterator.remove() or streams |
| StringBuffer vs StringBuilder | Confusion on when to use | StringBuffer = thread-safe (slower), StringBuilder = not thread-safe (faster) |
| == vs .equals() | Comparing objects incorrectly | == compares reference, .equals() compares content |
| Spring @Autowired NPE | Bean not injected | Don't use `new`, check annotations |

## Study Strategy for Difficult Topics

When stuck on a topic:

1. **Break it down** - What specific part is confusing?
2. **Try analogies** - Relate to real-world concepts
3. **Code examples** - Write small test programs
4. **Explain it** - Try teaching it to rubber duck 🦆
5. **Sleep on it** - Sometimes a break helps
6. **Ask Daya** - I'm here to help! 💪
