OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) Assignment :- 
Q1. Create a class 'Student' with fields (id, name, marks). Create methods to:
    - Set details
    - Display details
    - Calculate if the student passed (marks >= 40)
Input: 101, "Aman", 45 
Output: Student 101: Aman (Pass)
Explanation:
    Encapsulation (private fields, public methods)
    Conditional logic inside method

Q2. Create an abstract class 'Shape' with an abstract method 'area()'. 
    Create subclasses 'Circle' and 'Rectangle' that implement 'area()'.
Input: Circle(radius=5), Rectangle(l=4, b=5)
Output: Circle Area: 78.5, Rectangle Area: 20
Explanation:
    Abstraction and Inheritance
    Method Overriding

Q3. Write a program to demonstrate Method Overloading. Create a class 'Calculator' with 'add()' method:
    - add(int, int)
    - add(double, double)
    - add(int, int, int)
Input: add(2, 3), add(2.5, 3.5)
Output: 5, 6.0
Explanation:
    Compile-time Polymorphism
    Same method name, different parameters

Q4. Create an interface 'Vehicle' with methods 'start()' and 'stop()'. 
    Implement it in class 'Car' and 'Bike'.
Output: Car starting... Bike stopping...
Explanation:
    Interfaces for abstraction
    Implementing multiple behaviors

Q5. Demonstrate the use of 'super' and 'this' keywords. 
    Create a Parent class and Child class. Call parent constructor using 'super'.
Explanation:
    'this' refers to current object
    'super' refers to parent class members

======================================================================
Exception Handling Assignment :- 
Q1. Write a program to handle ArithmeticException (Division by zero).
Input: 10 / 0
Output: Cannot divide by zero!
Explanation:
    try-catch block usage
    Handling runtime exceptions

Q2. Create a custom exception 'InvalidAgeException'. 
    Throw this exception if age < 18 in a 'checkAge()' method.
Input: age = 15
Output: Exception: Age must be 18+
Explanation:
    Creating user-defined exceptions (extends Exception)
    Types of Exceptions (Checked vs Unchecked)

Q3. Write a program demonstrating 'finally' block.
    Open a scanner, perform an operation, and close scanner in 'finally'.
Output: Operation done. Scanner closed.
Explanation:
    Resource cleanup
    Finally block execution guarantee

Q4. Demonstrate 'throws' keyword. Create a method that throws IOException.
    Call this method in main and handle the exception.
Explanation:
    Propagating exceptions
    Checked vs Unchecked exceptions handling

======================================================================
Multithreading Assignment :- 
Q1. Create two threads: one printing numbers 1-5, another printing 6-10.
    Run them concurrently.
Output: (Mixed output like 1, 6, 2, 7...)
Explanation:
    Extending Thread class vs Implementing Runnable
    start() vs run()

Q2. Write a program to demonstrate thread synchronization. 
    Create a 'Counter' class with a synchronized 'increment()' method.
    Two threads increment the same counter 1000 times.
Output: Final Count: 2000
Explanation:
    Race conditions
    synchronized keyword usage

Q3. Implement a simple Producer-Consumer problem using wait() and notify().
    One thread adds items to a list, another removes them.
Explanation:
    Inter-thread communication
    Handling shared resources safely

======================================================================
Collections (Set & Map) Assignment :- 
Q1. Given a list of names with duplicates, print only unique names.
Input: ["Rahul", "Amit", "Rahul", "Sneha"]
Output: ["Rahul", "Amit", "Sneha"]
Explanation:
    HashSet behavior (No duplicates)
    Converting List to Set

Q2. Count the frequency of each character in a string using HashMap.
Input: "APPLE"
Output: {A=1, P=2, L=1, E=1}
Explanation:
    HashMap<Character, Integer>
    put(), getOrDefault(), containsKey() logic

Q3. Sort a HashMap by keys (e.g., Student IDs).
Input: {103="C", 101="A", 102="B"}
Output: {101="A", 102="B", 103="C"}
Explanation:
    TreeMap (Automatic sorting by key)
    Navigating Maps

Q4. Given two lists, find their intersection (common elements).
Input: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]
Output: [2, 3]
Explanation:
    retainAll() method or manual check
    Set intersection logic

======================================================================
Frontend (HTML & CSS) Assignment :- 
Q1. Create a simple 'Contact Us' form with:
    - Name (Text)
    - Email (Email)
    - Message (Textarea)
    - Submit Button
    Style it using CSS to center on the page.

Q2. Build a flexbox layout with:
    - Header (full width)
    - Sidebar (20% width)
    - Main Content (80% width)
    - Footer (full width)
    Color sections differently.

Q3. Create a responsive grid of cards (e.g., Product Cards).
    Use CSS Grid: calculate columns automatically based on screen size.
    (hint: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...)))

======================================================================
SQL Basics Assignment :- 
Q1. Write a SQL query to create a table 'Employee' with fields: id (PK), name, department, salary.

Q2. Write a query to insert 3 sample records into 'Employee'.

Q3. Write a query to fetch all employees from 'IT' department.
Query: SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE department = 'IT';

Q4. Write a query to find the employee with the highest salary.
Query: SELECT * FROM Employee ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1;
(OR using MAX subquery)

Q5. Write a query to update the salary of employee with id=101 to 60000.
Query: UPDATE Employee SET salary = 60000 WHERE id = 101;

Q6. Write a query to delete employees with salary < 10000.
Query: DELETE FROM Employee WHERE salary < 10000;
